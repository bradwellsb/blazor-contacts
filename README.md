# Blazor Contacts
This app is a complete contact management solution created by [Bradley Wells](https://wellsb.com/csharp/) using Blazor. It includes an OData Web API backend, an IdentityServer4 authentication server, and a server-side Blazor front-end targeting .NET 7. Use the solution as a template for creating your own real-world web applications.
